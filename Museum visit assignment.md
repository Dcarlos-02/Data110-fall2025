# Introduction 

To fulfill the museum visit assignment, I went to the National air and space museum--a Smithsonian museum located in Washington D.C. 
Opened in 1976, it is home to a great scientific heritage. It exhibits aviation and space infrastructures, along with terrestrial travel experiences.
Although it is a large facility, it does not display a lot of data visualization graphs. Below are some of the few displayed graphs. 


# aerobatic shows

The image above shows the pattern of aerobatic shows and the planes' maneuvers. 
On the graph you can see where the plane follow a horizontal path, where it goes vertically, and where it makes some rotations.

We also have an image above that shows the itinerary of the 1969 puff powder derby--an annual air race. 
The race covered a distance of 2,515.46 miles, starting from San Diego to Washington D.C.

Not only does it exhibit aviation related infrastructures, the museum is also home to a large volume of information about the planets, their components, their movements, and more. 

Below is an image that shows how the planets orbit around the sun. As seen, the planets keep a consistent circular movement in a nearly flat plane. 
However, Pluto follows a different orbit pattern. Unlike the other planet it moves in a more elevated plane.

# Global warming 

Another interesting discovery includes the display of graph that shows information about global warning and energy consumption.

Above, we have a graph that shows the trend of energy utilization throughout the day. It intends to help balance solar power with energy demand. 
On the x-axis we have different time of the day. On the y-axis we have the amount of power generated in gigawatts. The graph is a line plot that shows the trends within three categories. 
The green line represents the natural gases, the purple line represents solar energy, and the gray line represents the other sources of energy. 
As observed, more natural gases are used overnight. The green line reached its peak,approximately 22 gigawatts, after 6PM. 
As for solar energy, since the graph is bell shaped, using the empirical rule, we can conclude that 95% of solar energy is produced between 8AM and 6PM, with its highest level of production around 12PM. 
Finally, as for the other sources, just like the natural gases the highest consumption happens overnight.

The graph above is another line plot that shows the past and prospective trends in global warming starting from the 1900s to 2100.
The research was conducted by several organizations, with each color representing a different organization. 
The red line represents the center for climate system research.
The orange line represents the Canadian center for climate modeling and analysis.
The turquoise line represents the Geophysical fluid dynamical laboratory. 
The purple line represents the National center for atmospheric research. 
Overall, it is observable that the world will experience a major temperature rise, which will cause extreme heat, drought and even mass extinction. 

# Conclusion 

Visiting the Museum of Air and Space in Washington, D.C. was not only an opportunity to explore remarkable artifacts of aviation and space exploration, but also a chance to reflect on humanity’s drive to push boundaries. 
Walking among historic aircraft and spacecraft reminded me how innovation and perseverance have shaped our past and continue to inspire our future. 
The experience deepened my appreciation for the scientists, engineers, and explorers whose work has expanded our horizons, and it left me motivated to carry forward that same spirit of curiosity and discovery in my own journey.
